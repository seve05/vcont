# vcont

Requires: a running NFS Server, the user to know the dir + ip 

#Usage:
sudo chmod +x installvcont.sh

./installvcont.sh

Version control for my local network using NFS. I just want simple version control between machines with an easy setup, dont need connecting to any server besides my own. One command. Done.
This works for Linux only, atm. Not sure about WSL.
