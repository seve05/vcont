# vcont
Version control for my local network using NFS.
This works for Linux only, atm. Not sure about WSL.

Requires: a running NFS Server, the user to know the dir + ip 

#Usage:
sudo chmod +x installvcont.sh

./installvcont.sh

Once installed:

vcont myfile.filenameextension

You can reconfigure the IP of the server in ~bin/nfsipadr.txt.
